#### | 👵🏻 Intro.
LOKO, an Android mobile app designed with love and care, is built to empower the elderly to adopt a healthy lifestyle. By incorporating features that are familiar to the elderly (e.g., the lunar calendar) and engaging gamification elements, LOKO aims to bring joy and vitality to every elder's daily life and enrich their lives in a meaningful way.

#### | 🧩 How It Works
Every day, LOKO assigns four different types of tasks, including brain game, diet quiz, exercise, and mood-boosting exercise, to every user. The tasks will be displayed on a lunar calendar as a gentle reminder with a dash of humor. As the users complete their daily tasks, they will be rewarded with speical pictures that they can proudly share with their loved ones. Besides, the user also have access to exercise videos focusing on different body parts that they can follow along to stay active.

#### | 🌟 Key Features
